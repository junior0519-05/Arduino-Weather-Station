# Arduino-Weather-Station
A weather station made using arduino that will display temperature, humidity, and heat index

This project was made using the arduino IDE to program a microcontroller to collect and display the temperature, humidity, and heat index on a .96 inch OLED display. After finalizing the wiring it was soldered onto a perfboard to render it a partially permanent project.

Hardware Used:
- Arduino Pro Micro
- DHT11 sensor
- .96" OLED Display
- Breadboard wires
- Perfboard
